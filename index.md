The Text-to-speech In The Wild (TITW) dataset systematically segments, filters, and enhances human speech samples derived from the [VoxCeleb](https://mm.kaist.ac.kr/datasets/voxceleb/) dataset.
TITW dataset was collected to foster research in Text-To-Speech (TTS) models using data from in-the-wild, instead of those collected in anechoic rooms with high quality.
TITW dataset has also been used as the bona fide data of [SpoofCeleb](https://jungjee.com/spoofceleb) dataset.

# Data Access
The dataset is currently hosted on Hugging Face. Access is granted upon request and agreement to the terms of use.
Once the request is approved by the authors, you can download the dataset using the following instructions.

## How to Download
Before downloading, ensure that you have installed the huggingface-cli tool and logged in via:
- The user needs to install `huggingface-cli` and login via `huggingface-cli login`.
- For further setup guidelines, refer to the [link](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/repositories-getting-started).

To download the dataset:
```python
huggingface-cli download --repo-type dataset jungjee/titw
```

# License
